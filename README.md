# pwm-controller-pcb

For my PCB project, I designed and implemented a pulse-width modulation (PWM) controller that uses a 555 timer IC in conjunction with an N-channel MOSFET to achieve efficient load control. The circuit, laid out in Altium, incorporated supporting components such as diodes, resistors, capacitors, and a potentiometer to enable adjustable duty cycles within a compact and reliable design. Prior to fabrication, I conducted LTspice simulations to calculate charge, discharge, and cycle times, which guided component selection and PCB routing while eliminating potential design errors. After assembling and soldering the board, I validated the design using a multimeter and confirmed that the controller successfully generated variable duty-cycle waveforms, making it well-suited for applications such as motor speed regulation and LED dimming.
